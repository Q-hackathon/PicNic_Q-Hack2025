## Build the World's Greenest Supermarket

### üìÑ Problem Statement

Online grocery shopping is booming, bringing convenience to countless homes. As a tech-driven supermarket, we're already putting green practices into action ‚Äì using smart solutions like demand-based ordering to lower food waste, optimizing delivery routes with our electric vehicles, and streamlining warehouse flows. Still, we believe there's always room to enhance our positive impact on the planet.

We're looking for your innovative ideas to tackle two key environmental challenges in the world of groceries.

#### Minimizing Food Waste

How can we creatively reduce waste, both in our customers' homes and within our operations?

Think about leftovers from home cooking, whether they may be our products or part of our recipes, or even other sources like existing pantry items or takeout. Our tech-driven warehouses can have near-expiry items (currently discounted via the store), or those "perfectly imperfect" items (like dented cans or misshapen veggies, which we now donate in bulk).

Can we find innovative ways to utilize these products or even turn them into something customers will love?

#### Lowering Our Carbon Footprint

How can we empower customers to make greener choices?

This could involve helping them select products with a smaller environmental impact across the whole supply chain ‚Äì from source to home. We can also further incentivize customers to choose greener delivery options or recycle more. We already collect deposit bottles and our used delivery bags; while participation is high, there‚Äôs always room to improve.

To build even further on this, new initiatives could use our electric delivery vehicles for additional return streams. Ultimately, how can we further motivate these green behaviors or new ones?

Dream big. We're open to any innovative approach. Your solution could involve optimizing the supply chain, creating new app features (or a whole new companion app), developing clever algorithms, or finding ingenious ways to promote behavioral change. The possibilities are endless.

### üõ†Ô∏è **The Application That is Built**

A sustainability-focused, AI-enhanced grocery companion platform that reduces food waste and carbon footprint through smart features for both customers and operations.

### üíª Technology Stack

### ‚úÖ Deliverables of the Challenge

#### Expected Outcomes

A functional prototype/MVP should be developed.  
You are free in what kind of product you prototype. It may aim to extend our existing store app or be a fully standalone product.

Want to dive deep into AI? Great, feel free to explore the cutting edge. More passionate about clever app design, supply chain tweaks, or behavioral nudges? That's fantastic too. There's no required level of AI focus ‚Äì bring your best innovative ideas, whatever form they take.

#### Deliverables

- Problem statement and solution overview  
- Architectural diagram  
- Demonstration of the prototype  
- Impact assessment on sustainability  
- Future roadmap and potential scalability of the solution  

### üß∞ Provided Resources 

- You will receive mock data models for many of our domains: warehouse stock, product information, customer delivery data, delivery planning information.
- Slides about the Picnic business model and domain  
- Mentoring for hands-on work, and domain knowledge  
- Interview with Picnic‚Äôs sustainability expert  
- Icons and images for prototyping
